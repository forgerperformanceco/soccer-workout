# Yardsmith — Nutrition & Training Reference

The knowledge base behind the Yardsmith calculator and training plan. This is the
"why" behind every number the app produces, plus the broader sports-nutrition and
bodybuilding principles it's built on.

> **Important framing — is this golf-specific or just fitness?**

## 1. Energy: BMR & TDEE

**BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** — calories burned at complete rest. Yardsmith uses the
**Mifflin–St Jeor equation**, the most accurate predictive formula for the general
population:

```
Men:   BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) − (5 × age) + 5
Women: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) − (5 × age) − 161
```

**TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** = BMR × an activity multiplier:

| Activity level | Multiplier | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sedentary | 1.20 | Desk job, little/no exercise |
| Light | 1.375 | Light training 1–3×/week |
| Moderate | 1.55 | Training 3–5×/week |
| Very active | 1.725 | Hard training 6–7×/week |
| Athlete | 1.90 | 2-a-days / physical job + training |

TDEE is your **maintenance** calories — eat this and weight stays roughly stable.
Everything else is an adjustment up or down from here.

> **Reality check:** predictive equations carry a ±10% error. They are a *starting
> point.* Track bodyweight for 2–3 weeks and adjust calories ±100–200/day based on the
> actual trend, not the formula.

---

## 2. Goal calorie adjustments

| Goal | Adjustment | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| **Lean Bulk** | **+10%** (~+250–350 kcal) | Slow, lean muscle gain — minimal fat |
| **Bulk** | **+20%** (~+400–600 kcal) | Aggressive off-season mass |
| **Maintain** | **±0%** | Hold composition (e.g. in-season) |
| **Cut / Lean Out** | **−20%** (~−400–600 kcal) | Fat loss while protecting muscle |

**Surplus size matters.** Muscle is built slowly; a bigger surplus mostly adds *fat*,
not extra muscle. For most trainees past the beginner stage, a **+10–15% lean bulk** is
the sweet spot. A larger +20% bulk is for hard-gainers or those prioritizing strength
over leanness, and should be followed by a cut.

**Deficit size matters too.** A ~20% deficit (~0.5–1% bodyweight/week loss) is
aggressive enough to lose fat steadily but moderate enough — with high protein and hard
training — to retain muscle. Crash deficits cost muscle and performance.

> **The throughline: this is a mass-and-clubhead-speed program first.** Every goal serves
> that. Lean Bulk/Bulk add the muscle that raises your force (and speed) ceiling;
> Maintain holds it in-season. **A cut is not an aesthetics phase — it's a speed phase:**
> dropping fat while protecting muscle raises **power-to-weight**, so you swing **as fast
> or faster at a lighter, more athletic bodyweight** (see [§9](#9-where-golf-actually-changes-things)).
> Keep protein high and the speed/power work in even on a cut so the deficit costs fat, not mph.

## 3. Macro rules (and the science behind them)

Yardsmith sets macros in a fixed priority order: **protein → fat → carbs fill the
rest.** This is the standard physique-athlete approach.

### The app's rules (user-tuned)
1. **Protein = a percentage of total calories** — **30%** on Lean Bulk / Bulk / Maintain,
   **35%** on a cut. See [§4](#4-protein-the-master-nutrient).
2. **Fat = a fixed gram target per goal** — **Cut 50 g · Maintain 55 g · Lean Bulk 65 g ·
   Bulk 70 g.** A set number, not a percentage, so it stays predictable across bodyweights.
3. **Carbs fill the remaining calories**, then everything is **distributed across the day**
   (bigger dinner, low-fat post-workout meal — see [§6](#6-meal-frequency--per-meal-distribution)).
4. **Every number is rounded to the nearest 5 g** (and calories to the nearest 5) so the
   targets are clean and easy to hit — 200 g protein, not 197.

### Why this works
- **Protein as a % of calories** scales with the whole plan: a bigger eater training harder
  automatically gets more protein, and the **35% on a cut** pushes protein up exactly when
  muscle is most at risk (deficit). For typical golfers this lands around **0.9–1.1 g/lb**
  building and **1.0–1.3 g/lb** cutting — right where the evidence wants it (see §4).
- **Fat as fixed grams** keeps it from creeping too high or dropping too low. The targets
  (50/55/65/70 g) all sit **above the hormonal/health floor** (~0.3 g/lb or ~20% of calories
  for most people) while leaving plenty of room for carbs. Fat steps **up as you eat more**
  (bulk) and **down on a cut**, where those calories are better spent on protein and carbs.
- **Carbs last** because they're the "performance and flexibility" macro — they fuel
  high-intensity work, refill muscle glycogen, and are easiest to flex up (bulk) or down
  (cut) without touching the protein/fat that protect muscle and hormones.

### Standard evidence-based ranges (for context)
| Macro | Common range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Protein | 30–35% kcal (≈0.7–1.0+ g/lb / 1.6–2.2 g/kg) | Higher % on a cut |
| Fat | ≥0.3 g/lb (≈20–35% kcal) | App uses 50–70 g fixed — above the floor |
| Carbs | Remainder | 3–5 g/kg general; 5–8+ g/kg for high-volume training |

Calorie values: **protein 4 kcal/g, carbs 4 kcal/g, fat 9 kcal/g.**

## 4. Protein: the master nutrient

Protein is the single most important dietary lever for building or keeping muscle —
**when in doubt, err high.** It's satiating, it has the highest thermic effect, and
overshooting the "optimal" number costs nothing but a little money.

**What the research says (and why we bias upward):**
- **Morton et al. 2018** (meta-analysis, 49 RCTs, *Br J Sports Med*): muscle/strength gains
  *plateau* around **1.6 g/kg/day**, but the confidence interval runs up to **~2.2 g/kg
  (1.0 g/lb)** — so 1 g/lb is the smart upper anchor for building.
- **Helms et al. 2014** (review for lean athletes): in a **calorie deficit, go higher —
  2.3–3.1 g/kg (≈1.1–1.4 g/lb)** — and the leaner you are, the higher in that range, to
  protect muscle.
- **ISSN** position stand: 1.4–2.0 g/kg supports most athletes; for **fat loss, intakes
  >3.0 g/kg** are supported in lean, resistance-trained individuals.

**What Yardsmith uses** (protein as a **% of total calories**, rounded to 5 g):

| Goal | Protein (% kcal) |
|---|---|
| In-Season Maintain | **30%** |
| Lean Bulk | **30%** |
| Bulk | **30%** |
| Cut / Lean Out | **35%** |

Because protein scales with total calories, it ticks **up on a bulk** (more food, more
training to support) and the **35% on a cut** drives it **highest exactly when muscle is
most at risk**. In practice this lands most golfers around **0.9–1.1 g/lb** building and
**1.0–1.3 g/lb** cutting — squarely inside the evidence above.

- **~1 g/lb is the floor, not the ceiling.** Total daily intake is what matters most;
  hitting the number every day beats perfect timing.
- **Per-meal dose:** muscle protein synthesis is maximized by roughly **0.4 g/kg per
  meal** (~0.18 g/lb, ≈30–50 g for most people) — enough to clear the "leucine
  threshold" that triggers the building response.
- **Distribution:** spreading protein across **3–5 meals**, each hitting that threshold,
  is modestly better for muscle than skewing it all into 1–2 meals.
- **Quality:** complete proteins (meat, fish, eggs, dairy, whey) or well-combined plant
  proteins. Whey post-workout is convenient and fast-digesting but not magic — total
  daily intake dominates.
- **Leucine** is the key trigger amino acid (~2.5–3 g per meal); animal proteins and
  whey are naturally rich in it.

---

## 5. Nutrient timing: pre- & post-workout

Timing is a **fine-tuning** tool — real, but secondary to hitting your daily totals.
Its biggest practical value is *fueling the session* and *kick-starting recovery.*

### Pre-workout (≈ 60–90 min before)
- **Carbs** top off muscle glycogen and blood glucose so you can train hard. The app
  allocates a chunk of your daily carbs here (more on a cut, where carbs are scarce and
  best spent around training).
- Favor **easily digestible** carbs: oats, banana, rice, toast, or a sports drink.
- Include some **protein** (20–40 g) if it's been >3–4 hours since your last meal.
- **Training fasted (early morning)?** Fine for many people. Either have the pre-carbs
  *as you start* / sip a carb drink during, or just prioritize the **post-workout meal**.
  For pure performance on hard sessions, having some carbs beforehand usually wins.

### Post-workout (within ≈ 60 min of finishing)
- The "anabolic window" is wider than old bro-science claimed — it's roughly a few
  hours, not 30 minutes — **but** the post-workout meal is still your best single
  glycogen-refill and recovery opportunity, so make it count.
- **Carbs** rapidly replenish glycogen (most important if you train again within ~24 h).
  Faster carbs (rice, potatoes, fruit, dextrose) refill quickest.
- **Protein** (~30–50 g) supplies the amino acids for repair and growth. **Pair carbs
  with protein** post-workout.
- **Per-plan emphasis** (how Yardsmith weights it):
  - **Bulk** → load the post-workout window hardest (biggest glycogen + growth window).
  - **Lean Bulk** → post-workout is your main "build" feeding.
  - **Maintain** → split fairly evenly around training; save some carbs for the round.
  - **Cut** → concentrate limited carbs tightly around the workout; stay lower elsewhere.

### Hydration & electrolytes
- ~5–7 mL/kg water in the 2–4 h before training; replace ~125–150% of fluid lost in
  sweat afterward. Sodium and potassium matter for long, hot sessions — and for golf.

---

## 6. Meal frequency & per-meal distribution

- **Total intake > meal frequency.** Whether you eat 3 or 6 meals, daily totals drive
  results. Frequency is mostly about **adherence, hunger, and hitting per-meal protein.**
- **Practical sweet spot: 3–5 meals/day**, each with a protein dose above the leucine
  threshold (~30–50 g).
- **More meals** help when you need to eat a *lot* (bulking) or prefer smaller, frequent
  feedings. **Fewer, larger meals** are often more satiating on a **cut.**
- Yardsmith's recommended **main-meal counts**: Lean Bulk 4 · Bulk 5 · Maintain 4 ·
  Cut 3 — with a pre-workout carb snack and the post-workout meal placed *around training*.

### How Yardsmith distributes the macros (not evenly!)
Real people don't eat identical meals. The app **weights each meal by its role** so the
day reads like a normal one:
- **Dinner** is the biggest meal — most protein, more fat.
- **Breakfast** carries a bit more fat (eggs) and carbs (oats).
- **Snacks** are lighter.
- The **post-workout meal goes low-fat / high-carb** — fat slows digestion and blunts the
  glycogen refill, so it's pushed to the *other* meals.
- Each meal is **clock-timed and shifts with your workout slot** (the meal nearest training
  becomes the post-workout meal). All meals still **sum exactly** to your daily totals.
- **Per-meal protein** lands above the leucine threshold (~30–50 g) at every main meal.

---

## 7. Bodybuilding / hypertrophy principles

The training side of adding muscle ("build like a bodybuilder").

- **Progressive overload** is the engine: over time, add weight, reps, or sets. If the
  load never increases, the muscle has no reason to grow. **Log every session.**
- **Volume** drives hypertrophy: roughly **10–20 hard sets per muscle group per week**
  for most intermediates, split across 2 sessions/muscle/week.
- **Rep ranges:** hypertrophy happens across a wide range (~5–30 reps) *if sets are
  taken close to failure* (~0–3 reps in reserve). The classic **8–15 rep** zone is
  time-efficient and joint-friendly for most accessory work; heavier **3–6 rep** work
  builds the maximal strength that raises your ceiling.
- **Exercise selection:** anchor on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, hinge, press, row,
  pull-up) for the most muscle worked per unit time, then add isolation for lagging areas.
- **Rest:** 1.5–3 min for hypertrophy accessory work; 3–5 min for heavy strength sets.
- **Recovery is where growth happens:** 7–9 h sleep, managed stress, and enough food.
  You don't grow in the gym — you grow recovering from it.
- **Periodization — consistent & concurrent beats block-switching here.** You do *not*
  need to spend weeks on pure hypertrophy, then switch to a pure strength block, then a
  pure power block. The evidence is clear:
  - **For muscle growth, the periodization model barely matters when volume is equated.**
    Meta-analyses (Schoenfeld/Grgic; linear vs. daily-undulating) find essentially *no
    difference* in hypertrophy between block, linear, and undulating models.
  - **For strength, undulating/concurrent is equal or slightly better**, especially as you
    advance (~3–5% better 1RM in trained lifters when volume is matched).
  - **Block periodization mainly helps advanced/elite athletes** who need novel stimuli.
    For everyone else, a **consistent week that trains all qualities together** is just as
    effective for size, a touch better for strength, and keeps speed sharp year-round.
  - You **don't lose muscle** training this way — there's no "interference" between lifting
    for size and lifting for strength/power, and brief intensity shifts don't detrain you.
- **So Yardsmith uses one consistent, concurrent week for all 20 weeks** — heavy strength,
  hypertrophy volume, and power/speed in every week — progressed by **progressive overload**
  (add a little weight or a rep most weeks) with a **deload every 6th week.**

### Strength · Power · Speed (the qualities you train together)
- **Strength** = max force you can produce. Built with heavy, lower-rep compound work.
- **Power** = force × velocity — applying force *fast.* Explosive/ballistic lifts and jumps.
- **Rate of Force Development (RFD)** = how quickly you reach high force — the quality most
  tied to swing speed, trained with jumps, throws, and overspeed swings.
- These aren't a strict sequence — **train them concurrently.** More muscle raises your
  force ceiling, strength makes that muscle useful, and power/speed work turns it into
  clubhead speed. Pure size that can't fire fast doesn't move a club (or a barbell) quickly.

---

## 8. Gaining ~10 lb of muscle: realistic rate & timeline

- **Muscle is built slowly.** Realistic *lean* gain rates:
  - Beginner: ~1–1.5 lb/month (~0.25–0.5% bodyweight/week)
  - Intermediate: ~0.5–1 lb/month
  - Advanced: ~0.25–0.5 lb/month
- Target a scale-weight gain of **~0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week** (~0.5–0.75 lb/week
  for a 180–200 lb person). Faster than that is mostly fat, which hurts mobility and
  rotation.
- **10 lb of *muscle*** therefore realistically takes an intermediate **~4–8 months** of
  consistent lean-bulk training and eating — not weeks. Some of the *scale* gain will be
  fat and water; plan a short cut afterward to reveal the new muscle.
- **Non-negotiables for the 10 lb:** progressive overload, ~1 g/lb protein daily, a
  modest surplus (+10%), and 7–9 h sleep. Miss any one and the rate stalls.

## 9. Where golf actually changes things

This is the short list — almost everything above is general fitness. Golf only adds:

> **The full "what physically produces clubhead speed" breakdown** — the kinetic chain,
> X-factor, ground force, the driver→exercise map, and public speed benchmarks — lives in
> its companion doc [`CLUBHEAD-SPEED-REFERENCE.md`](./CLUBHEAD-SPEED-REFERENCE.md).

> **Does the "mass → distance" thesis actually hold?** An independent, peer-reviewed-first
> research pass (verified in `CLUBHEAD-SPEED-REFERENCE.md` §11) says **yes, with the framing this
> program already uses.** Lean/fat-free mass tracks with clubhead-speed gains (fat-free-mass ↔ CHS
> **r ≈ 0.42**; body mass **r ≈ 0.51** in elite males); **strength and power are the dominant
> physical drivers** (upper-body power **r ≈ 0.51**, lower-body strength **r ≈ 0.46**; 1RM back
> squat **r ≈ 0.54–0.64**), and controlled programs *raise* driver speed and distance in men, women,
> and 50+ golfers. The nuance that shapes our language: it's **lean, fast-firing muscle → power →
> distance**, **not bulk** — and **general flexibility does essentially nothing for speed
> (r ≈ 0.03).** So build the muscle, convert it to power, and keep the mobility work for what it
> *actually* earns (injury-proofing, below).

1. **Power-to-weight ratio.** Clubhead speed comes from power *relative to bodyweight* and
   how fast you rotate — not raw size. Don't bulk into immobility. A leaner, more powerful
   athlete often out-drives a heavier, slower one. This is why Yardsmith frames bulking
   as a *means to speed*, with a Lean Out phase to follow.
2. **Mobility & rotation earn their place — mostly as injury insurance.** Big muscles that
   can't turn won't help your driver, but be honest about *why* we train mobility: passive
   flexibility does **not** predict clubhead speed (r ≈ 0.03), whereas a **lead-hip
   internal-rotation deficit (~10°) is strongly tied to golfers' low-back pain.** So we keep
   thoracic-rotation and hip-mobility work in — even during a hard bulk — to **protect the
   back and preserve the range the swing needs**, not as a speed hack. *(Detail: CLUBHEAD §11.6.)*
3. **On-course fueling (the genuinely golf-specific bit).** A round is **4–5 hours of
   low-intensity walking plus repeated high-skill, high-focus efforts.** Nutrition goals
   shift from *building* to *sustaining energy and cognition*:
   - **Steady carbs** every few holes (fruit, trail mix, a banana, a sandwich) to keep
     blood glucose and focus stable — late-round mental fatigue wrecks scores.
   - **Hydration + electrolytes**, especially in heat — even mild dehydration degrades
     focus and fine motor control.
   - **Avoid big sugar spikes/crashes** and heavy, greasy meals mid-round.
   - Don't slash carbs during tournament stretches; the brain and the swing both run on
     glucose over a long day.
4. **Speed training transfer.** Overspeed swing protocols, rotational med-ball throws, and
   anti-rotation core work translate gym power into the specific rotational pattern of the
   golf swing. (This is training, not nutrition — but it's the golf-specific payoff of the
   mass you build.)

### Golf-strength exercise selection (what credible sources agree on)
Reputable golf-fitness sources (University of Utah Health's golf clinic, Golf Digest,
Par4Success) converge on the same priorities — which this program already covers:
- **Hips + thoracic-spine rotation/mobility** — the two joints built for the swing's turn.
- **Ground-up power** — force starts at the ground: squat, deadlift, jumps, lateral bound.
- **Core as conduit AND brake** — anti-rotation (Pallof, plank) to *decelerate* and create
  the whip, not endless crunches.
- **Hip hinge / RDL** — Golf Digest calls the Romanian deadlift "one of golf's magic exercises."
- **Rotational power** — med-ball rotational throws and slams.
- **Single-leg & lateral work** — stability plus the swing's lateral weight shift. *(A lateral
  bound was added to the speed day for exactly this.)*

### Building the hinge — the deadlift, in the right order
The posterior-chain hinge (RDL / deadlift) is the highest-value golf strength lift: it builds
exactly the glute–hamstring–back drive the downswing runs on. Build it in three stages — a
standard, injury-smart strength-and-conditioning progression, reinforced by golf-fitness
coaching:

1. **Screen readiness first (a club is all you need).**
   - **Seated good morning** — sit tall, club across the shoulders, hinge from the hips to ~45°
     past vertical keeping a **neutral spine** (no rounding, no over-arching). Isolates and
     grooves the hip hinge.
   - **Single-leg RDL (± rotation)** — balance on one leg, hinge to mid-shin, fire the glute;
     add a rotation over the lead side for a golf-specific version. Tests balance, glute
     control and ground contact *before* you load a bar. If the pattern is ragged here, groove
     it before loading.
2. **Learn light, then load: band → kettlebell → barbell.** A band teaches the fire-through-the
   -range feel with **zero spinal load**; a kettlebell adds load with less technical demand than
   a bar; the barbell comes once the pattern is automatic. Cues throughout: **chest down, knees
   out, hips back, neutral spine — drop into the ground, then push up.**
3. **Then progressively overload.** Once the pattern is solid, drive the big lift up over
   **6–12 weeks** (higher reps / lighter → heavier / lower reps) — the same double-progression
   the plan already uses.

**Trap-bar first for most golfers.** Of the deadlift variants, the **trap-bar** is the top
pick: it loads the legs hard with **less shear stress on the spine** than a conventional pull —
leg drive without hammering the back, which is exactly golf's need. Conventional and sumo are
fine alternates for variety or hip preference. *(The plan already features RDLs and a trap-bar
jump; a trap-bar deadlift is the natural heavy-hinge option.)*

**The swing payoff — and the fault it fixes.** Hinge strength shows up as **holding posture
through impact.** When the glutes/posterior chain are too weak to stabilize, golfers stand up
out of their hinge into the ball — **early extension** — which sprays the strike and leaks
speed. A strong, stable hinge is what lets you keep your angles and *deliver* force instead of
giving up position. (Consistency matters as much as load: train the hinge regularly and heavy
stops feeling "novel" — long gaps are what make a return to lifting feel stiff and sore.)

Everything else — TDEE, macros, protein targets, surplus/deficit size, nutrient timing,
meal frequency — is **the same as for any fit, muscle-building athlete.**

---

## 10. The app's exact formulas & config

So this file fully documents the data behind Yardsmith.

### Macro logic (per day)
```
target_kcal = TDEE × (1 + calorie_adj)
protein_g   = round5( target_kcal × protein_pct / 4 )   // % of calories, per goal
fat_g       = fat_target_g                              // fixed grams, per goal
carb_kcal   = target_kcal − (protein_g × 4) − (fat_g × 9)
carb_g      = round5( carb_kcal / 4 )                   // fills the rest (never below 0)
```
`round5(n)` = round to the nearest multiple of 5. Calories are also shown rounded to 5.

### Per-goal settings
| Goal | Calorie adj | Protein (% kcal) | Fat (fixed g) | Weekly target | Post-WO carb wt | Rec. meals |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lean Bulk | +10% | 30% | 65 g | **+0.25–0.5%/wk** | 1.60 | 4 |
| Bulk | +20% | 30% | 70 g | **+0.5–0.75%/wk** | 1.60 | 5 |
| Maintain | ±0% | 30% | 55 g | hold (±0) | 1.60 | 4 |
| Cut / Lean Out | −20% | 35% | 50 g | **−1 to −0.5%/wk** | 1.60 | 3 |

> **Weekly target** is a % of bodyweight per week, shown in the app as a live lb/week band
> (e.g. a 175 lb lean-bulker sees ≈ +0.4–0.9 lb/week). Carbs — including pre/post-workout —
> are split across **every feeding by weight**, so portions shrink as you add meals. Meals
> are **clock-timed and anchored around your workout**: the meal nearest training becomes the
> post-workout meal, with a separate pre-workout carb feeding ~90 min before.

### Carb-timing clock anchors
| Slot | Assumed training time | Pre-carbs (~90 min before) | Post-carbs (~90 min after) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Morning | 7:00 AM | ~5:30 AM | ~8:30 AM |
| Midday | 12:00 PM | ~10:30 AM | ~1:30 PM |
| Afternoon | 4:00 PM | ~2:30 PM | ~5:30 PM |
| Evening | 7:00 PM | ~5:30 PM | ~8:30 PM |

### Meal plan (role-weighted, not even)
Macros are **distributed by meal role**, not split evenly, then summed to match the daily
total exactly. All carbs (including pre/post-workout) are split across every feeding by
weight, so portions shrink as you add meals:

| Meal role | Protein wt | Carb wt | Fat wt |
|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | 0.95 | 1.05 | 1.25 |
| Lunch | 1.05 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Dinner | 1.15 | 0.90 | 1.35 |
| Snack | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.55 |
| Post-workout meal | (by role) | 1.60 | role × 0.35 |
| Pre-workout snack | 0 | 0.80 | 0 |

### 20-week training: one consistent, concurrent week
Run the **same week for all 20 weeks** (4 or 5 training days). Every week trains all three
qualities — no block-switching (see §7 for the evidence).

| Day | Focus | Rep ranges |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 — Lower (Squat) | Heavy squat + hypertrophy accessories | 4–5 heavy, 8–15 |
| Day 2 — Upper (Push) | Heavy press + hypertrophy | 4–5 heavy, 8–15 |
| Day 3 — Speed & Power | Overspeed swings, throws, jumps, ground force | max velocity |
| Day 4 — Lower (Hinge + Power) | Jump + heavy deadlift/hinge + accessories | power, 4 heavy, 8–12 |
| Day 5 — Upper (Pull + Rotate) | Pulls + rotational power | 6–15 |

**4-day option (balanced, not a deletion).** Choosing 4 days does **not** simply drop a day —
it runs a purpose-built balanced split so pushing and pulling stay matched: **Day 1 Lower
(Squat + Hinge) · Day 2 Upper (Push) · Day 3 Speed & Power · Day 4 Upper (Pull + Rotate).**
Both lower patterns live on Day 1, anti-rotation (Pallof) and rotational power are retained,
and no upper-body pulling is lost.

**Every training day opens with a 5-minute warm-up** — hip and thoracic-spine mobility on
the relevant days (90/90 switches, open-book rotations, leg swings, band pull-aparts), plus
ramp-up sets — because mobility and rotation are sacred for the swing (see §9).

Each lift shows a **target RIR (reps in reserve) and rest time** so effort is explicit.
Progress by **double progression**: hold the weight until you hit the **top of the rep range
on every set**, then add ~2.5–5 lb (upper) / 5–10 lb (lower). **Deload every 6th week**
(weeks 6, 12, 18: ~60% loads, drop the last set, speed work submaximal) — the app shows a
deload banner automatically on those weeks. Eat in a **Lean Bulk** the whole time.

**Power primers (speed on every lift day).** Each lift day now opens with a single explosive
"primer" done **first, fresh** — a jump (squat day), explosive med-ball chest pass (push day),
Russian kettlebell swing (hinge day), or rotational med-ball throw (pull day) — kept to a few
max-intent reps with full rest (~5 min). This trains speed **3–4×/week** instead of once,
potentiates the heavy lift that follows, and adds **no** metabolic fatigue, so it doesn't cost
hypertrophy. The dedicated **Speed & Power day stays** for focused overspeed-swing volume —
primers supplement it, they don't replace it. The rule that makes it work: stay low-rep, max
intent, fully rested, and always first. Beginners ramp in (start at 2 sets / low box, add a
set every couple of weeks) and stop well short of fatigue.

**Tracking the payoff:** log **7-iron clubhead speed** weekly in the app's Progress panel.
7-iron is more repeatable than driver, so the week-to-week trend is a cleaner signal that the
mass you're building is converting into speed.

### Evidence-based refinements (research-validated)

A deep review of the literature (clubhead-speed transfer, power/explosivity, mobility,
hypertrophy/periodization, injury prevention) confirmed the program is well-aligned and added
these tweaks:

- **Power, not flexibility, drives clubhead speed.** Meta-analyses find flexibility/balance are
  **not** significantly associated with CHS (r≈0.03); the strongest correlates are jump impulse
  (r≈0.79), squat-jump (r≈0.82 in pros), and upper-body explosive/med-ball power. Mobility work
  stays — but for **ROM, X-factor and injury prevention**, not as a "speed" method.
- **Overspeed: light beats heavy.** Heavier-only club swings can *reduce* speed; gains come from
  **light implements swung at maximal velocity, 3×/week with a rest day**, behind a strength
  readiness check. The speed-day cue now says so.
- **Velocity quality.** Power reps build speed only while they're fast — **stop a set the instant
  reps visibly slow**; keep loads light and rest full. (Velocity-loss research.)
- **Eccentric / deceleration.** The low back is the #1 golf injury and most non-contact injuries
  occur in deceleration; eccentric work cuts strain injuries ~50%. Lift cue now emphasizes a
  **~3-second lowering**, and jumps require **landing competency before height**.
- **Grip / forearm.** Grip strength correlates with ball speed and protects the lead wrist/elbow
  (top amateur upper-limb injuries) — added direct wrist work on the pull day.
- **Volume realism.** Hypertrophy shows steep diminishing returns past ~10–12 hard sets/muscle/
  week, and strength needs even fewer — so the program holds moderate volume rather than chasing
  it, preserving recovery for the power/speed work.
- **In-season & peaking.** Maintain size/strength on **~1–2 hard heavy sets/muscle, 1–2×/week**;
  to peak for an event, **cut volume ~40–50% for ≤2 weeks while holding intensity** (~3–6% power
  bump). See the in-app "In-season & peaking" panel.
- **Sleep is a performance variable.** Sleep loss degrades **skill control** (swing tempo/strike)
  more than strength — aim 7–9 h.

> Concurrent-training note: the interference effect mainly blunts **power**, and **running** is
> the worst offender. This program prescribes no endurance work; if you add conditioning, prefer
> **cycling**, keep it in a separate session, and keep volume modest.

## 11. Supplements: the few that actually work

Most supplements are a waste of money. A short list has real, repeatable evidence and is
relevant to building mass and swing speed:

- **Creatine monohydrate — 3–5 g/day, every day** (timing irrelevant). The most
  evidence-backed legal supplement there is: more strength, power, lean mass, and
  training capacity — all of which feed clubhead speed. Cheap. No loading phase needed.
- **Protein powder (whey or plant)** — not magic, just a convenient way to *hit your
  daily protein number.* Useful post-workout or when whole food isn't handy.
- **Caffeine — ~3 mg/kg ~45–60 min pre-session** — a genuine performance and focus
  boost for training (and the front nine).
- **Vitamin D / creatine / electrolytes** for general health and hydration on long, hot
  rounds. Get most micronutrients from food first.

Everything else (BCAAs, testosterone "boosters", fat burners, exotic pre-workouts) is
mostly marketing. Food, protein, creatine, sleep, and progressive overload do ~95% of it.

## 12. How Yardsmith compares to other calculators

Yardsmith's logic lines up with the most respected evidence-based calculators — and
errs slightly higher on protein, by design.

| Source | Protein | Fat | Carbs | Surplus / deficit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RippedBody** (Andy Morgan / Leangains) | ~1 g/lb | 15–25% kcal (cut), 20–30% (maint/bulk) | remainder | adjust via carb:fat 2:1 |
| **Bony to Beastly** | 0.7–1 g/lb | 20–40% kcal | 40–60% kcal | bulk ≈ +750 kcal, ~0.5 lb/wk |
| **Bodybuilding.com** | ~30% kcal (gain) / 40% (loss) | 20–30% kcal | 40% kcal | by goal & body type |
| **Yardsmith** | **1.0–1.2 g/lb** | **≤65 g (50 g cut)** | remainder | +10/+20% or −20% |

Common ground across all of them: **protein set by bodyweight first, fat second (with a
floor/ceiling), carbs fill the rest, and a moderate surplus (~+10–20%) gained at roughly
0.5 lb/week.** Where they differ is mostly preference. Yardsmith deliberately runs
protein at the **top** of the evidence range, caps fat to protect carbs (which fuel hard
training and a long round), and adds the golf-specific carb-timing and meal schedule.

## 13. Applied example: Bryson DeChambeau (vetted)

DeChambeau is the most public test of the "build mass → make it speed" idea. The internet
is full of "Bryson workout" articles — **most are reconstructed, unverified, or
exaggerated.** Here's the honest split.

**✅ Worth copying (credible, evidence-aligned, already in this plan):**
- **Mass → force → speed pipeline.** He added ~40 lb and roughly *doubled force output*,
  which drove swing speed from ~117 to 130–140+ mph. Bigger, stronger muscle = a higher
  speed ceiling. (Roskopf / MAT; Como force-plate work.)
- **Compound lifts as the base** — squat, deadlift, RDL, hip thrust, bench, row — plus
  isolation for weak links. **Plyometrics** (box jumps) and **med-ball throws** for power.
- **Ground force + footwork** (push off the ground, lead foot fires early) and **overspeed
  swing training** with weekly radar tracking — the actual speed transfer.
- **Strength + mobility together** (MAT, plus yoga/flexibility work) so the bigger body
  can still rotate.
- **Basics that matter:** ~1 g/lb+ protein, **creatine**, hydration, and lots of sleep.

**🚩 Clickbait — do NOT copy:**
- **"23 lb of muscle in 12 weeks" / "27 lb fat lost at the same time."** Physiologically
  implausible — real lean-muscle gain is ~0.5–1 lb/month for intermediates (see §8).
  These numbers come from content-farm body-fat estimates, not reality.
- **"Exact Bryson routine" splits** (e.g. Mon chest/shoulders…) on aggregator sites are
  *reconstructed guesses*, often self-contradictory ("isolation over compound" then
  listing heavy compounds). Don't treat them as gospel.
- **"Better than steroids"** and similar — marketing hyperbole.
- The **dirty bulk itself.** His 6,000-cal everything-goes phase caused dizziness, gut
  issues and mood swings, and he later stripped ~20–30 lb to a leaner, *still-fast* build
  that won the 2024 U.S. Open. The lesson: a **clean lean bulk beats a dirty one.**

**Bottom line:** this program already encodes what's credible from his approach. We did
not change the training based on the dubious "routine" articles — they validate the
principles; their numbers don't survive scrutiny.

## 14. Applied example: Rory McIlroy — 2025 Masters (vetted)

McIlroy's 2025 Masters win — completing the career Grand Slam — is the clearest modern
proof of the "train like an athlete, for years, to play better golf" thesis. His
publicly-reported program lines up almost exactly with what Yardsmith already
prescribes. *(Facts below are drawn from mainstream reporting and trainer/recovery-coach
interviews — Golf Monthly, WHOOP, and similar — not from any single proprietary source;
where a claim mattered it was cross-checked against multiple outlets.)*

**✅ Worth copying (credible, evidence-aligned, already in this plan):**
- **Long-horizon, phase-based development.** He began structured training with exercise
  physiologist Dr. Steve McGregor around **2010**, on a **stability → strength → power**
  progression; the green jacket arrived ~**15 years** later. The lesson is the one in
  [§8](#8-gaining-10-lb-of-muscle-realistic-rate--timeline): real athleticism is built
  over **months and years, not weeks** — which is exactly why Yardsmith runs repeatable
  20-week blocks, not a "12-week transformation."
- **A concurrent in-season micro-split.** In tournament weeks he reportedly runs ~3
  quality gym touches — a **heavy strength day** (trap-bar deadlifts, weighted pull-ups),
  a **golf-only day**, and an **explosive power day** (box jumps, medicine-ball throws,
  light loads moved fast) — then mobility/activation the rest of the week. This is the
  same **concurrent, low-volume/high-intensity in-season** model in our in-season panel
  ([§10](#10-the-apps-exact-formulas--config)).
- **Power trained explosively and fresh.** Box and broad jumps, rotational and overhead
  medicine-ball throws, landmine rotations and cable work — for **ground force** and
  **anti-rotation**. These are the same rate-of-force-development, rotational-power, and
  "core as a brake" priorities in our speed day and lift-day **power primers**
  ([§7](#7-bodybuilding--hypertrophy-principles), [§9](#9-where-golf-actually-changes-things)).
- **Recovery treated as training.** Post-round easy bike spin, pneumatic compression
  (Normatec), percussion (Theragun), and sleep/strain monitoring (WHOOP) — mirroring our
  "recovery is where growth happens, **7–9 h sleep**" rule ([§7](#7-bodybuilding--hypertrophy-principles)).

**🚩 Treat with caution (don't copy blindly):**
- **Exact "celebrity routines" are reconstructions.** The specific sets/reps/loads in
  aggregator articles are inferred, not gospel. Use the *principles*; set your own loads
  by **double progression** ([§10](#10-the-apps-exact-formulas--config)).
- **The gear is optimization, not the cause.** Normatec/Theragun/WHOOP help him recover —
  they don't create the result. Sleep, food, and progressive overload do ~95% of it
  ([§11](#11-supplements-the-few-that-actually-work)).
- **Don't chase his numbers.** Tour-pro loads and speeds are the product of 15 years of
  training and full-time support. The **transfer principle** copies; the absolute numbers
  don't.

**Bottom line:** McIlroy's program is an elite, well-resourced version of the *same*
concurrent, power-biased, recovery-anchored approach Yardsmith encodes — built
patiently over years. It validates the method; the specific routine numbers are not the
point.
